A comprehensive full-stack web application built with FastAPI and React that enables organizations to efficiently manage employee payroll, salary slips, and expense tracking. The system features secure JWT-based authentication, role-based access control for Admins and Employees, and a modern minimalist user interface with TailwindCSS styling. Admins can create and manage salary slips, approve or reject employee expenses, and view analytics dashboards with salary distribution and expense trends. Employees can view their salary history, submit expenses for approval, and track personal salary trends through interactive charts. The backend provides 14+ REST API endpoints with SQLAlchemy ORM for SQLite database management and Argon2 password hashing for security. The application is fully deployable locally on ports 8000 (backend) and 5173 (frontend) and ready for cloud deployment on Render.com with comprehensive documentation provided.
